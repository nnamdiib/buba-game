Simple shooter game made using the Pygame library.

Known bugs:
	- Creating instances of BadGuy class duplicates the ENEMYIMG and creates a separate varibale for each instance.

	- Creating instances of BadGuy class duplicates the ENEMYIMG and creates a separate varibale for each instance. 
	  
	- The above leads to unneccesary duplication of resources, and wastes memory. 

	- Images are not truly .png (Sigh).
